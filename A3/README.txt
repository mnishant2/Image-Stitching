In order to reproduce the results run main.m and press any key when you get an image,to continue.
You can test both horizontal and vertical data by changing the directory name while loading file, same for my own data taken using phone.
Be careful with the horizontal given data, pass only a subset of images based on RAM size available
Also you can see both matchFeatures and bhattacharya results by passing 0 and 1 as the last arguments in findMatches respectively.
